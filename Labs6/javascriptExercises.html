    <h1>Javascript Exercises solution:</h1>
    <pre>
1. What is the difference between the following 2 statements? <div class="code">
    setTimeout(booyah, 2000);
    setTimeout(booyah(), 2000);</div>
    </pre>

    <div class="solution">
        <span>Answer:</span>
        In this code snippet, first line will invoke booyah function after 2000 milliseconds.
        Second line of code with booyah() inside setTimeout means this function booyah() will be
        called immediately.

    </div>
    <br />
    <pre>
2. What do the following 2 alerts display (answer without running the code)?<div class="code">
    var myfunc = function(a, x) {
        return a * x;
    };
    var x = myfunc(2, 3);
    var y = myfunc;
    alert(x);
    alert(y(2,3));</div>
    </pre>

    <div class="solution">
        <span>Answer:</span>
        Both the alert will display 6 as pop up in the browser which comes from 2 * 3 input fields.
        So 6 will be displayed / popped up twice.

    </div>

    <br />
    <pre>
3. Write functions booyah1 and booyah2 so that in both cases below, an alert box comes up after 2 seconds that
says “BOOYAH!” <br/>setTimeout(booyah1, 2000); <br/>setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000); 
</pre>


    <div class="solution">
        <span>Answer:</span>
        <pre class="codesolution">
function booyah1() {
    alert("BOOYAH!");
}            

function booyah2() {
    return function() {
        alert("BOOYAH!");
    };
}

setTimeout(booyah1, 2000);
setTimeout(booyah2(), 2000);
</pre>
    </div>

    <br />
    <pre>
4. What is "Unobtrusive Javascript"? What is the practical application of Unobtrusive Javascript (and the reasons
for using it)?
    </pre>

    <div class="solution">
        <span>Answer:</span>
        Unobtrusive JavaScript is a way of writing JavaScript so that your site visitors are not
        shut out of your site for one of these reasons—even if your JavaScript is not working
        correctly for them, they should still be able to use your site, albeit at a more basic level.
        <br /><br />
        One of the practical application of using Unobtrusive JavaScript is <span class="highlightme">separating the
        javascript code from the html code</span> by writing all javascript code inside .js file. The main reasons for using this
        is code will be less error prone, debugging gets easier, easy to update the code. The idea is that
        javascript code should be means to enhance our web page rather than absolute neccessary elements
        to make the website.
